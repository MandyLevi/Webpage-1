          <h1>the z-warriors</h1>

          <p>
          Meet the <strong>Z-Warriors</strong> of the Dragon Ball Z world.<br/> <br/>

          <em>Zetto Senshi</em> also known as the <strong>Z-Warriors</strong> or <strong>Earth's Special Forces</strong> are a small group of warriors located on planet Earth. <br/> <br/>

         Through the many battles they have fought in order to test their skills and reach other goals, they have become the unofficial defenders of Earth. Due to them just being a group of martial artists who group up from time to time they have no official leader or particular positions and members will act of their own accord at times though most if not all have some sort of sense of justice or eventually develop one and will make drastic decisions to defend their home. Throughout the years, the group consistently bolstered its ranks through the addition of former enemies and new heroes and routinely overcame seemingly insurmountable opponents, always emerging victorious against progressively more powerful foes. <br/> <br/>

         These mighty warriors know not only to spit blood and flex their gigantic muscles, they also happen to be a bunch of -- well...how should I put it? A bunch of very dashing specimen if I do say so myself. Not an important point to mention, but still -- that's just me fangirling :P <br/> <br/>

         And now let me introduce you to my top 4 Z-Warriors in descending order of strength.
